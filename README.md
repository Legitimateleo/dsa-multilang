# dsa-multilang
A personal project to reimplement the data structures and algorithms I’ve learned in C++ using languages like JavaScript and Python.

This repository contains my implementations of core data structures
and algorithms in multiple languages:

- C++
- Python
- TypeScript

My goals:
- Practice coding and committing a little every day.
- Re-implement the same concepts across languages to deepen understanding.
- Build a clear portfolio to share with recruiters.

## Structure

- `cpp/` – C++ implementations
- `python/` – Python implementations
- `typescript/` – TypeScript implementations

Within each language:
- `linked-lists/`
- `trees/`
- `graphs/`
- `algorithms/` (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)

## Progress Overview
